Highway Data Examiner in Parallel(HDXP) can be installed on any web server.  In addition to installing the files here, it requires access to the Travel Mapping "lib" directory to find common code and images.  A copy of `TravelMapping/Web` can be installed for this purpose.  In the HDX installation directory, "tmlib" needs to be a copy of `TravelMapping/Web/lib` or be a link to one.


## Main Purpose
The main purpose of this program is to use the Travel Mapping data to visaulize algorithms in a simulated parallel environment.  The program is designed to be used in a classroom setting to teach parallel algorithms.  The program can also be used to visualize the algorithms in a way that is more intuitive than reading about it in a paper.
